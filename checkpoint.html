    <h1>Work Completed So Far</h1>
    <p>It took unexpectedly long to install PyCUDA, but we have thus far been able to implement all of what we hoped to achieve in Week 2, which gives a way to input images and cut the image into square sections. We have also decided on a way to determine an &ldquo;image match&rdquo;, where for each square, we will average the RGB values in each quadrant and find the closest match. This method would definitely be better than averaging all values, as we realized a split black and white image could return grey, which is not what we want.</p>
